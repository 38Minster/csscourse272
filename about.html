    <p>When I was at school I was introduced to poetry by people who well meaningly tried to introduce us all to rhyming schemes by brushing past the iambic pentameter and verse forms by introducing us to the Japanese Haiku, which never really inerested me, and the sonnet, which at least felt a little more familiar, but which I felt we were rushed past because Shakespeare had written sonnets. Here is what we were taught.: they were love poems and they were thirteen lines long, then, before we could get stuck into who they were love poems between we were rushed on to some more masculine study. Perhaps I was too slow then to take on board what my teachers were trying to introduce us to. If I was, then I was in good company, since no one around me seemed to take it in, or perhaps there was no time in the curriculum to spend time over our native, wonderful verse forms. I shall never know, but here is a little about of what I feel was left out of my education.</p>
